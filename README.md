# individual-lab-1
This is where everyone will submit their work for Lab 1

## Lab One

### Context
This assignment is not related to your project, per se. However, I am using it so you can practice a typical SDLC workflow from a team perspective. To do this assignment, we will be using git as our source control and Github as our project management tool.

### The Teams
It is up to you to come up with legendary team names.

- Team One
  - Laura
  - Michelle
  - Jess
  - Mike

### Acceptance criteria
I have created a [milestone](https://github.com/csci-2479-au-2022/individual-lab-1/milestones). I will create an issue for each member of the team.

Our team needs to do the following:
1. Complete an issue in your milestone for each person on the team with the following requirements:
   - Create an html file with the name `firstname-lastname.html` under the `/bios` directory
   - This file should contain a brief bio about yourself. Feel free to include information similar to what was shared in the icebreaker, such as:
     - Where you are from originally
     - Your major/track at CSCC
     - What you hope to do after school
     - What you enjoy doing as a hobby or pastime
   - Create a link to this file on the `index.html` page
3. Each student needs to work their own issue and do the following:
   1. Create a feature branch for their work with the name format `feature/your-feature-name`, e.g. `feature/andrew-harris-bio-page`
   2. Once the work is finished, commit everything to your branch locally, and then push the branch to Github.
   3. Create a pull request (PR) and a sign a teammate as a reviewer
      - Also make sure to [link the PR to your issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue); I tend to use the keywords in the PR description like "resolves #11"
   4. Review another teammate's pull request
      - In this case, we're mostly writing content, not code, but we can still look for properly formatted HTML documents, etc.
      - See [this blog](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/best-practices/pull-requests/our-code-review-etiquette.html) for help understanding what is good code review etiquette.
      - I expect to see at least one comment per PR; if nothing else, a simple "Everything looks great, approving!" will suffice.
   5. The student who created the PR should merge the PR once it is approved, and they should also verify that the issue is closed.
