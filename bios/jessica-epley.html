    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gardening - currently I have 2 vegetable gardens in which we grew tomatoes, corn, green beans, peppers, stevia, and many others.</li>
        <li>Video games such as the Diablo series, TFT / League of Legends, and Civ 6.</li>
        <li>Lifelong learning - I love to continuously learn best practices</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2>My path at CSCC</h2>
    <p>I'm not taking a traditional school path into computer science and web development. Currently, I'm a recruiter for accounting and finance professionals.
        I've realized after 6 years that the work isn't as fulfilling as it used to be. It's been great impacting people's lives to find new careers, and about 1.5 years accounting
        I decided it was my turn to make a step into a different path. Since I've always been a little nerdy and lvoe computers / games / and making things look nice, I feel
        web development will be the perfect mix of science, math, and art.
        <br>
        Ideally, I'd like to start in consulting for web development. Beyond that, I'm not sure where I'll land. I could see going the project management route due to my 'sales' background, or continuing
        into some sort of full-stack development. Right now, there are plenty of options and finishing school is the first step!
