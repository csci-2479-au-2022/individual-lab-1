    <h2>Michael McAdow</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.<br><br>
        I am a Web Developer Major at CSCC<br><br>
        After graduating, I hope to begin working as a Junior Web Developer or Software Developer.<br><br>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing music and exploring music technology. More specifically, I like to play guitar, drum machines, and both desktop and modular synthesizers.
